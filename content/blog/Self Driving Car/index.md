## Demo

## Features

- User-controlled car movements with arrow keys.
- AI-controlled cars using a neural network.
- Collision detection with road borders and traffic.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Functions

### `Car.update(roadBorders, traffic)`

Updates the car's position and state based on road borders and traffic. Includes movement, collision detection, and AI controls.

### `Controls.#addKeyboardListeners()`

Adds keyboard listeners for arrow keys to control the car.

### `Road.getLaneCenter(laneIndex)`

Calculates the center of a lane based on the given lane index.

### `Sensor.update(roadBorders, traffic)`

Updates the sensor readings based on road borders and traffic.

### `Visualizer.drawNetwork(ctx, network)`

Draws the neural network on a given canvas context.
